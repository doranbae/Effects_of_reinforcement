# Measuring the Effect of Positive/Negative Reinforecement

######This is a final project for Berkeley's Field Experiments class
####Background
The experiment is designed to provide insight on the following question: Does conformity have a discernible impact on a person’s confidence? The project group conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effect of interpersonal influence on a respondent’s self-determined confidence level. 

####Finding
The research found that peer reinforcement can affect a person's self-confidence. For example, if a person believes that they are backed by their peers they will be more confident in their decision and if they are opposed by their peers they will be less confident. It was also discovered that positive reinforcement appears to be more effective at boosting self-confidence than negative reinforcement is at reducing it.
